In LAMMPS, a **fix** is a modular component that applies specific operations to a group of atoms  during a simulation. Fixes are used to impose constraints, apply forces, modify atom properties, or perform other tasks at each timestep. The purpose of a fix in LAMMPS is to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to add a custom functionality, and implement custom behavior by overriding relevant methods.

The OBMD extension is implemented as a LAMMPS fix, enabling grand-canonical molecular dynamics simulations with special boundary conditions and external forces. It operates by:
- Managing particle insertion and deletion in buffer regions,
- Applying external forces to maintain user-defined boundary conditions,
- Communicating particle data across processors using MPI.

#### Key Components of the OBMD Fix

1. **Fix Class**: The fix is implemented as a C++ class derived from the base `Fix` class. The base class provides a common interface and utility functions.

2. **Initialization**: Fixes are initialized during the setup phase of a simulation. This includes parsing input parameters, allocating memory, and preparing any data structures required for the fix.

A fix is defined in the input script using the `fix` command. For example:
   ```bash
   fix             2 all obmd
   ```
This applies the OBMD fix to all atoms.

3. **Interaction with LAMMPS MD Procedure**: Fixes are executed at specific points during the simulation. This fix overrides two key methods of the `Fix` base class to perform its operations, as specified with the `setmask()` function.

	- **`pre_exchange()`**: Handles particle insertion and deletion. This function is invoked before atoms are exchanged between processors. It:
	  - Deletes particles that cross open boundaries.
	  - Computes the number of particles to be inserted based on buffer conditions.
	  - Inserts new particles into specified regions using the USHER or near algorithms.
	  - Deletes particles that may overlap or violate boundary conditions.
	
	- **`post_force()`**: Applies external forces to atoms in specified regions. This function is called after force calculations in the MD timestep. It:
	  - Computes momentum and shear forces based on user-defined parameters.
	  - Distributes forces across atoms using weighting functions (e.g., smooth or step distributions).

MPI is used to distribute work across CPUs in a parallel simulation environment:
- **Particle Deletion**: The `try_deleting()` function identifies particles to be deleted based on their positions. MPI is used to:
  - Reduce deletion counts across processors.
  - Ensure consistent deletion of particles across the distributed domain.

- **Particle Insertion**: The `try_inserting()` function attempts to insert particles into specified regions. MPI is used to:
  - Broadcast insertion attempts and results.
  - Ensure particles are inserted without overlap across processors.

- **Force Distribution**: Functions like `reg_force()` and `reg_force_perp()` compute and apply forces to atoms. MPI is used to:
  - Sum forces across processors.
  - Distribute forces proportionally to atom properties.
