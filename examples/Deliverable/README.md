# User guide
To perform OBMD simulations using the `obmd` extension, we provide a **python script** `input.py` that generates input script for LAMMPS named `in.simulation`.
A code snippet of the **function** in the `input.py`  script that writes an input script for OBMD simulation of a **DPD fluid** is given and explained below.

### Initialization settings
The function `write_in(in_file)` is defined and takes as an argument the name of the input file to be created.
Here, `in.simulation`.
Using f-string, the block of code that forms the input script is stored in `content_4in`.
The latter is ultimately written to a file using `file_to_write.write(content_4in)`.
```python
in_file = "in.simulation"

# ------------------------------------------------------- #
def write_in(in_file):
    file_to_write = open(in_file, 'w')

    content_4in = f"""
# ----------------- Variables Section -----------------

```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> OBMD simulations should be performed using **reduced units** (`units lj`) to avoid errors in the calculation of the external force and the style of boundaries (i.e., `boundary`) for the global simulation box in each dimension should be set to `f p p`. The latter applies the same style to the lower and upper sides of the simulation box, i.e., in the case of OBMD simulations, the non-periodic style `f` is applied in the $x$-direction, while the box is periodic in $y$- and $z$-directions by choosing the periodic style `p`.

> [!NOTE]
> `atom_style`: The style of atoms in the system. 
>>The OBMD extensions was tested using `atomic`, `full`, and `molecular` atom styles.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When performing OBMD simulations, a momentum-conserving thermostat should be applied.
> Usually, the **DPD thermostat** is used, where velocities should be communicated between neighboring processors and stored as properties of ghost atoms using `comm_modify vel yes`.
> Importantly, the Newtonâ€™s third law for pairwise and bonded interactions should be enabled via `newton on`.

One should also define geometric regions of space. 
Here, **6 regions**, namely `leftB`, `rightB`, `leafshear`, `rightshear`, `leftBin`, and `rightBin`, should be given. 
All regions should be defined using the following format: $xlo$ $xhi$ $ylo$ $yhi$ $zlo$ $zhi$ (units of box).

> [!NOTE]
> `leftB`: Region defining the left buffer.
>>`buffer_size`: length of the buffer region, `xlo`, `ylo`, `zlo` are the lower bounds of the simulation box in the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-direction, respectively, while `xhi`, `yhi`, `zhi` are the upper bounds.
> 
> `rightB`: Region defining the right buffer.
> 
> `leftshear`: Region defining part of the left buffer where shear forces are applied.
>>`shear_size`: length of the region where shear flow is imposed. If only normal pressure forces will be applied, e.g., equilibrium simulations, `shear_size`, `xlo`, `ylo`, `zlo`, `xhi`, `yhi`, and `zhi` should be set to 0.0.
>
> `rightshear`: Region defining part of the right buffer where shear forces are applied.
>
> `leftBin`: Region defining part of the left buffer where new particles are inserted.
>> `offset`: offset the value of the $xlo$, $xhi$, $ylo$, $yhi$, $zlo$, $zhi$ insertion region.
>
> `rightBin`: Region defining part of the right buffer where new particles are inserted.

### Simulation settings and system definition
```python
# ----------------- Interaction Section -----------------
pair_style      dpd {temp} {rc} {rnd_dpd}

# ----------------- Atom Definition Section -----------------
read_data       dpd_8map_obmd.data

# ----------------- Settings Section -----------------
pair_coeff      * * {aij} {gamma_dpd} {rc}

neighbor        {skin} bin
neigh_modify    delay 0 every 1

timestep        {dt}

fix             1 all nve
```
In this case, `pair_style dpd` is used to perform simulations employing the DPD force filed.
According to the [LAMMPS documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/pair_dpd.html) it takes temperature (`temp`), cutoff of the interaction (`rc`), and seed (`rnd_dpd`) as input parameters.
Alongside, the following [coefficients](https://docs.lammps.org/pair_dpd.html) (`pair_coeff`) must be given: interaction parameter between atoms $i$ and $j$ (`aij`), friction parameter (`gamma_dpd`), and cutoff of the interaction (`rc`).
> [!NOTE]
> `read_data` is used to read pre-equilibrated configuration of the DPD fluid given in the `dpd_8map_obmd.data` file.

> [!CAUTION]
> `dpd_8map_obmd.data` contains information about the positions of the atoms in **reduced units**.
> It is important that the position of the atoms do not exceed $xlo$ or $xhi$ of the simulation box; if so, they should be manually "deleted" before conducting the OBMD simulations.

>
>`pxx`: Pressure applied onto the buffer.
>> It represents the equilibirum pressure of the fluid and can be derived from the equation of state (for the DPD fluid), or obtained from NVT simulation by monitoring the pressure to which the system relaxes. Can be provided as a real constant or as a variable (`v_pxx`).
>
>`pxy`: Shear stress with forces along the $y$-axis.

>
> `stepperp step_perp`: Weighting function used to distribute the total external force acting in tangetial direction.
>> Here, `stepperp` is set to the value of `step_perp`. For now only **heaviside step weighting function is applied**, therefore, `step_perp` must be set to `1` (also default value).

>> Here, the maximum number of attempts is set to the value of `max_attempt`.

### Simulation execution
```python
# ----------------- Compute Section -----------------

#

# ----------------- Output Section -----------------
run             {steps}
    """
    file_to_write.write(content_4in)
    file_to_write.close()

# ------------------------------------------------------- #

# write input script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    write_in(in_file)
    print(f"file {in_file} is written")
```
The `run` option is used to run the simulation, where `steps` represents the number of simulation steps to be executed.
Finally, the `in.simulation` is written using `file_to_write.write(content_4in)`.
